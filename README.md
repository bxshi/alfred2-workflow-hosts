# Alfred2-Workflow-Hosts

## Introduction

This is a simple productivity tool which could help you focus on your work. 

## Usage

Firstly, download the [workflow file](http://github.com/bxshi/alfred2-workflow-hosts/Web Blocker) 

Then, double click on it to install it into your Alfred2.

After you install it, just open your Alfred and type 

`weblock [website you want to ban]` 

or

`webunlock [website you want to unlock]`

Isn't that simple?

## Shortage

Actually this workflow is not that *simple*, because we are editing something belonging to __system__, each time you block/unblock some websites, you need to enter the password.

## Todo

* Auto-completion for websites
* Showing banned list
* Maybe add a timer to automatically unlock a website (Yes I'm copying *SelfControl*, feel free to check [my SelfControl Repo](http://github.com/bxshi/selfcontrol))
